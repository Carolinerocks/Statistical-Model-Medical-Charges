# Statistical Model - Medical Charges

**1. Overview**  

This project investigates the factors influencing individual medical insurance costs using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The analysis aims to identify significant predictors, explore interactions, and develop a robust predictive model to support fair insurance pricing and risk assessment.

**2. Languages Used**  

- R Language
- R Markdown

**3. Analytical Methods**  

- Hypothesis Testing: To examine significant differences between variables such as smoking and charges or BMI and charges.
- Multiple Linear Regression: To explore the combined impact of variables like age, BMI, smoking status, and more on insurance costs. Both additive and interaction models were built.
- Model Diagnostics: Assumptions like multicollinearity, linearity, and homoscedasticity were validated to ensure model reliability.

**4. Tools and Packages**  

Data Visualization: ggplot2 creates scatter plots, residual plots, and interaction visualizations.
Statistical Validation: The Breusch–Pagan test and Shapiro-Wilk test are used for assumption testing.
Regression Analysis: Stepwise regression, polynomial features, and interaction terms.

**5. Conclusion**

This project analyzes the factors influencing individual medical insurance costs using a methodical and iterative modeling approach. By progressively building models—from additive to interaction and higher-order models—the team gained a deeper understanding of how each variable impacts insurance charges and improved the interpretability of the results. The inclusion of interaction terms and higher-order variables allowed the capture of complex non-linear relationships, significantly enhancing model fit. To ensure the reliability and robustness of the analysis, diagnostic tools such as residual plots, Breusch-Pagan tests, and Shapiro-Wilk tests were employed to validate statistical assumptions. This comprehensive approach highlights the value of systematic model development in understanding healthcare costs.
